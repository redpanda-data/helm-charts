# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and is generated by [Changie](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie).


## v5.10.1 - 2025-04-08
### Changed
* bumped `appVersion` to [v25.1.1](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases/tag/v25.1.1).
### Fixed
* Fixed an issue where not explicitly specifying a SASL auth mechanism when SASL is enabled caused Console to fail to start up.
* Prevent broker nodes from restarting when solely the cluster replica amount changes

## v5.9.21 - 2025-03-03
### Changed
* Promoted the config-watcher sidecar into a real go binary that handles user management and simplifies cluster health checks so they no longer fail when the sole issue is that other nodes in the cluster are unavailable. Additionally the new sidecar subsumes the behavior of the `statefulset.sideCars.controllers` stanza which should now be specified via their own `enabled` flags.
* `clusterDomain` now defaults to `cluster.local.` (A trialing `.` has been added) and the chart no longer adds trailing `.`'s to internal domains.

  For users not experiencing issues with trailing `.`'s this change has no
  effect. For users that have had issues with trailing `.`'s, it's now possible
  to opt-out of this behavior by explicitly setting `clusterDomain` to `cluster.local`.

  For users that override `clusterDomain`, copied a previous releases
  values.yaml, or use the `--reuse-values` flag, trailing `.`'s will be tripped
  from domains upon updating. This behavior may be opted into by appending a
  `.` to `clusterDomain` prior to upgrading.
* Bump AppVersion to v24.3.6 Redpanda release
* Bump Redpanda operator side car container tag to `v2.3.7-24.3.6`.
### Fixed
* Reverse order of applying resources to first create ClusterRole and then ClusterRoleBinding.
  When Redpanda custom resource has enabled RBAC the reconciliation was blocked due
  ClusterRoleBinding referencing not yet created ClusterRole.


## v5.9.20 - 2025-02-06
### Changed
* Attempted lookups of the bootstrap user's existing password are no longer gated by `.Release.IsUpgrade`.

  This is unlikely to affect existing workflows as `Lookup` is likely stubbed
  out in situations where `.Release.IsUpgrade` is incorrectly set. i.e. `helm
  template`.

  See also [#1596](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/issues/1596).

## v5.9.19 - 2025-01-14
### Added
* Added `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` as an alternative method of managing the redpanda container's resources.

  When both `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` are specified, the
  redpanda container's `resources` will be set to the provided values and all
  other keys of `resources` will be ignored. Instead, all other values will be
  inferred from the limits and requests.

  This allows fine grain control of resources. i.e. It is now possible to set
  CPU requests without setting limits:

  ```yaml
  resources:
    limits: {} # Specified but no cpu or memory values provided
    requests:
      cpu: 5 # Only CPU requests
  ```

  For more details see [redpanda's values.yaml](./charts/redpanda/values.yaml).
### Changed
* `statefulset.podTemplate` no longer specifies a `"redpanda"` container. This
  was unintentionally generating empty containers when `nameOverride` was used.
* Bump Redpanda operator side car container tag to `v2.3.6-24.3.3`
### Fixes
* out of range slice error when Redpanda custom resource has set `useFlux` to
  `false` and `Fullname` function would return string that has less
  than 49 characters. It could be caused with usage of `nameOverwrite` input
  value.

#### Added
* Added the ability to override the name of the bootstrap user created when SASL authentication is enabled. [#1547](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/pull/1547)
#### Changed

#### Fixed
* Chart render failures in tooling compiled with go < 1.19 (e.g. helm 3.10.x) have been fixed.
#### Removed
* `post_upgrade_job.*`, and the post-upgrade job itself, has been removed. All
  it's functionality has been consolidated into the `post_install_job`, which
  actually runs on both post-install and post-upgrade.

  The consolidated job now runs the redpanda-operator image, which may be
  controlled the same way as the additional controllers:
  `statefulset.controllers.{image,repository}`.

### [5.9.5](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.9.5) - 2024-09-26
#### Added
#### Changed
* Bump Redpanda container tag/application version [#1543](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/pull/1543)
#### Fixed
* Connectors deployment [#1543](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/pull/1543)
#### Removed

### [5.9.4](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.9.4) - 2024-09-17
#### Added
#### Changed
* Cluster configurations are no longer include in `redpanda.yaml` or the
  Redpanda Statefulset's configuration hash.

  This change makes it possible to update cluster configurations without
  initiating a rolling restart of the entire cluster.

  As has always been the case, users should consult `rpk cluster config status`
  to determine if a rolling restart needs to be manually performed due to
  cluster configuration changes.

  Cases requiring manual rolling restarts may increase as fewer chart
  operations will initiate rolling restart of the cluster.
#### Fixed
* Fix initialization of configurations using RestToConfig when the passed in rest.Config contain on-disk value files.
#### Removed
* All zero, empty, or default cluster configurations have been removed from
  `values.yaml` in favor of letting redpanda determine what the defaults will
  be. 

  Documentation of cluster configurations has also been removed in favor of
  linking to Redpanda's docs.

### [5.9.3](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.9.3) - 2024-09-11
#### Added
* Add basic bootstrap user support (#1513)
#### Changed
#### Fixed
* When specified, `truststore_file` is no longer propagated to client configurations.
* If provided, `config.cluster.default_topic_replications` is now respected regardless of the value of `statefulset.replicas`.
#### Removed

### [5.9.1](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.9.1) - 2024-8-19
#### Added
#### Changed
#### Fixed
* The `truststores` projected volume no longer duplicates entries when the same
  trust store is specified across multiple TLS configurations.
#### Removed

### [5.9.0](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.9.0) - 2024-08-09
#### Added
* `post_install_job.podTemplate` and `post_upgrade_job.podTemplate` have been
  added, which allow overriding various aspects of the corresponding
  `corev1.PodTemplate`. Notably, this field may be used to set labels and
  annotations on the Pod produced by the Job which was not previously possible.
* `statefulset.podTemplate` has benefited from the above additions as well.
  `statefulset.podTemplate.spec.securityContext` and
  `statefulset.podTemplate.spec.containers[*].securityContext` may be used to
  set/override the pod and container security contexts respectively.
* `appProtocol` added to the `listeners.admin` configuration
#### Changed
* The container name of the post-upgrade job is now statically set to
  `post-upgrade` to facilitate strategic merge patching.
* The container name of the post-install job is now statically set to
  `post-install` to facilitate strategic merge patching.
* `statefulset.securityContext`, `statefulset.podSecurityContext`,
  `post_upgrade_job.securityContext`, and `post_install_job.securityContext`
  have all been deprecated due to historically incorrect and confusing
  behavior. The desire to preserve backwards compatibility and not suddenly
  change sensitive fields has left us unable to cleanly correct said issues.
  `{statefulset,post_upgrade_job,post_install_job}.podTemplate` may be used to
  override either the Pod or Container security context.
#### Fixed
#### Removed

### [5.8.15](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.8.15) - 2024-08-08

#### Fixed
* Fix mechanism check in superuser file creation
#### Removed

### [5.8.14](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.8.14) - 2024-08-07
#### Added

#### Changed
* Convert connectors to go
* Bump redpanda, connectors, operator and console helm chart application version
#### Fixed
* Fix Redpanda node configuration generation, so that rpk can parse it
* Fix volume mounts in mTLS setup
* Correct boolean coalescing
#### Removed

### [5.8.13](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.8.13) - 2024-07-25
#### Added
#### Changed
* Updated `appVersion` to `v24.1.11`
#### Fixed
* Fixed a regression where `post_upgrade_job` would fail if TLS on the admin
  listener was disabled but had `cert` set to an invalid cert (e.g. `""`)
* Fixed mTLS configurations between Redpanda and Console [#1402](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/pull/1402)
* Fixed a typo in `statefulset.securityContext.allowPriviledgeEscalation`. Both the correct
  and typoed name will be respected with the correct spelling taking
  precedence. [#1413](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/issues/1413)
#### Removed
* Validation of `issuerRef` has been removed to permit external Issuers.
  [#1432](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/issues/1432)

### [5.8.12](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/releases/tag/redpanda-5.8.12) - 2024-07-10

#### Added

#### Changed
* `image.repository` longer needs to be the default value of
  `"docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda"` to respect version checks of
  `image.tag`
  ([#1334](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/issues/1334)).
* `post_upgrade_job.extraEnv` and `post_upgrade_job.extraEnvFrom` no longer accept string inputs.

    Previously, they accepted either strings or structured fields. As the types
    of this chart are reflected in the operator's CRD, we are bound by the
    constraints of Kubernetes' CRDs, which do not support fields with multiple
    types. We also noticed that the [CRD requires these fields to be structured
    types](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/blob/9fa7a7848a22ece215be36dd17f0e4c2ba0002f7/src/go/k8s/api/redpanda/v1alpha2/redpanda_clusterspec_types.go#L597-L600)
    rather than strings. Too minimize the divergences between the two, we've
    opted to drop support for string inputs here but preserve them elsewhere.

    Updating these fields, if they are strings, is typically a case of needing
    to remove `|-`'s from one's values file.

    Before:
    ```yaml
    post_upgrade_job:
      extraEnv: |-
      - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: special-config
              key: special.how
    ```

    After:
    ```yaml
    post_upgrade_job:
      extraEnv:
      - name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: special-config
            key: special.how
    ```

    If you were using a templated value and would like to see it added back,
    please [file us an
    issue](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/issues/new/choose) and
    tell us about your use case!

#### Fixed
* Numeric node/broker configurations are now properly transcoded as numerics.

#### Removed
