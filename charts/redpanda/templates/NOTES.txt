{{- $anySASL := (include "sasl-enabled" . | fromJson).bool }}

Congratulations on installing {{ .Chart.Name }}!

The pods will rollout in a few seconds. To check the status:

  kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} rollout status statefulset {{ template "redpanda.fullname" . }} --watch

{{- if (default .Values.external true) }}
Get your node's external IP addresses with the following command:
  kubectl get nodes -o wide

Then set the REDPANDA_BROKERS environment variable using the external IPs:
  export REDPANDA_BROKERS=<external IP>:31092,<external IP>:31092,<external IP>:31092

Add IP addresses for each of the {{ .Values.statefulset.replicas }} nodes in your cluster (the above example lists three).

Now rpk can be used like this when using sub-commands that access the Kafka API port:
  rpk cluster info

For rpk sub-commands that use the admin API port, run rpk with the following flag:
  rpk cluster health --api-urls <external IP>:31644,<external IP>:31644,<external IP>:31644
{{- end }}

Try some sample commands:

{{- if and $anySASL }}
Create a user:

  {{ $rpk }} acl user create myuser -p changeme --mechanism {{ include "sasl-mechanism" . }} {{ include "rpk-common-flags" . }}
{{- end }}

Get the api status:

  {{ $rpk }} cluster info {{ include "rpk-common-flags" . }}

Create a topic

  {{ $rpk }} topic create test-topic {{ include "rpk-topic-flags" . }}

Describe the topic:

  {{ $rpk }} topic describe test-topic {{ include "rpk-topic-flags" . }}

Delete the topic:

  {{ $rpk }} topic delete test-topic {{ include "rpk-topic-flags" . }}
