Congratulations on installing {{ .Chart.Name }}!

The pods will rollout in a few seconds. To check the status:

  kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} rollout status statefulset {{ template "redpanda.fullname" . }} --watch

{{- if and (toJson (dict "bool" .Values.external.enabled)) (eq .Values.external.type "LoadBalancer") }}

If you are using the load balancer service with a cloud provider, the services will likely have automatically-generated addresses. In this scenario the advertised listeners must be updated in order for external access to work. Run the following command once Redpanda is deployed:

  {{ printf "helm upgrade %s redpanda/redpanda -n %s --set $(kubectl get svc -n %s -o jsonpath='{\"external.addresses={\"}{ range .items[*]}{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip }{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}{\",\"}{ end }{\"}\\n\"}')" (include "redpanda.name" .) .Release.Namespace .Release.Namespace }}
{{- end }}

Try some sample commands:

{{- if and $anySASL }}
{{- $_ := set $rpk "dummySasl" true }}

Create a user:

  {{ include "rpk-acl-user-create" $rpk }}

Give the user permissions:

    {{ include "rpk-acl-create" $rpk }}
{{- end }}

Get the api status:

  {{ include "rpk-cluster-info" $rpk }}

Create a topic

  {{ include "rpk-topic-create" $rpk }}

Describe the topic:

  {{ include "rpk-topic-describe" $rpk }}

Delete the topic:

  {{ include "rpk-topic-delete" $rpk }}
