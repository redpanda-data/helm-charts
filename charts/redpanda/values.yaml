    # This setting is equivalent to `--smp`, `resources.requests.cpu`, and `resources.limits.cpu`.
    # For production, use `4` or greater.
    #
    # To maximize efficiency, use the `static` CPU manager policy by specifying an even integer for
    # CPU resource requests and limits. This policy gives the Pods running Redpanda brokers
    # access to exclusive CPUs on the node. See

    # If you are setting the following values manually, keep in mind the following guidelines.

    # The amount of memory to allocate to a container is determined by the sum of three values:

    # 2. Seastar subsystem (200Mi * 0.2% of the container's total memory, 200Mi < x < 1Gi)
    # 3. Other container processes (whatever small amount remains)
    # redpanda:
      # Memory for the Redpanda process.
      # This must be lower than the container's memory (resources.memory.container.min if provided, otherwise
