#
resources:
  # Both Redpanda and Kubernetes have multiple ways to allocate resources.
  # There are also several associated parameters that impact how these resources are used by
  # Kubernetes, the Redpanda app, and the subsystem Redpanda is built on (Seastar).
  # This section attempts to simplify allocating resources by providing a single location
  # where resources are defined.
  # Helm sets these resource values within the following templates:
  # - statefulset.yaml
  # - configmap.yaml
  #
  # The default values below are what should work for a development environment.
  # Production-level values and other considerations are provided in comments
  # if those values are different from the default.
  #
  cpu:
    # Redpanda makes use of a thread per core model described here:
    # https://redpanda.com/blog/tpc-buffers
    # For this reason, Redpanda should only be given full cores (cores parameter below).
    #
    # NOTE: You can increase cores, but decreasing cores is not currently supported:
    # https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/350
    #
    # Equivalent to: --smp, resources.requests.cpu, and resources.limits.cpu
    # For production: 4 or greater
    cores: 1
    #
    # Overprovisioned means Redpanda won't assume it has all of the provisioned CPU.
    # This should be true unless the container has CPU affinity (eg. min and max above are equal).
    # Equivalent to: --idle-poll-time-us 0 --thread-affinity 0 --poll-aio 0
    # overprovisioned: false
  #
  memory:
    # Enables memory locking.
    # For production: true
    # enable_memory_locking: false
    #
    # It is recommended to have at least 2Gi of memory per core for the Redpanda binary.
    # This memory is taken from the total memory given to each container.
    # We allocate 80% of the container's memory to Redpanda, leaving the rest for
    # the Seastar subsystem (reserveMemory) and other container processes.
    # So at least 2.5Gi per core is recommended in order to ensure Redpanda has a full 2Gi.
    #
    # These values affect --memory and --reserve-memory flags passed to Redpanda and the memory
    # requests/limits in the StatefulSet.
    # Valid suffixes: k M G Ki Mi Gi
    # Only support a single decimal (eg. 2.5Gi rather than 2.55Gi)
    #
    container:
      # Minimum memory count for each Redpanda broker
      # If omitted, the min value will equal the max value (requested resources defaults to limits)
      # Equivalent to: resources.requests.memory
      # For production: 10Gi or greater
      # min: 2.5Gi
      #
      # Minimum memory count for each Redpanda broker
      # Equivalent to: resources.limits.memory
      # For production: 10Gi or greater
      max: 2.5Gi
    #
    # redpanda:
      # This optional redpanda section allows specifying the memory size for both the Redpanda
      # process and the underlying reserved memory (used by Seastar).
      # This section is omitted by default, and memory sizes are calculated automatically
      # based on container memory.
      # Uncommenting this section and setting memory and reserveMemory values will disable
      # automatic calculation.
      #
      # If you are setting the following values manually, keep in mind the following guidelines (getting
      # this wrong will potentially lead to performance issues, instability, loss of data, etc.):
      # The amount of memory to allocate to a container is determined by the sum of three values:
      # 1. Redpanda (at least 2Gi per core, ~80% of the container's total memory)
      # 2. Seastar subsystem (200Mi * 0.2% of the container's total memory, 200Mi < x < 1Gi)
      # 3. other container processes (whatever small amount remains)
      #
      # Memory for the Redpanda process.
      # This must be lower the container's memory (resources.memory.container.min if provided, otherwise
      # resources.memory.container.max).
      # Equivalent to: --memory
      # For production: 8Gi or greater
      # memory: 2Gi
      #
      # Memory reserved for the Seastar subsystem.
      # Any value above 1Gi will provide diminishing performance benefits.
      # Equivalent to: --reserve-memory
      # For production: 1Gi
      # reserveMemory: 200Mi

  # Tiered Storage helps to lower storage costs by offloading log segments to cloud storage.
