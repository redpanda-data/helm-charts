# -- Pod resource management.
# @raw
# This section simplifies resource allocation for the redpanda container by
# providing a single location where resources are defined.
#
# Resources may be specified by either setting `resources.cpu` and
# `resources.memory` (the default) or by setting `resources.requests` and
# `resources.limits`.
#
# For details on `resources.cpu` and `resources.memory`, see their respective
# documentation below.
#
# When `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` are set, the redpanda
# container's resources will be set to exactly the provided values. This allows
# users to granularly control limits and requests to best suit their use case.
# For example: `resources.requests.cpu` may be set without setting
# `resources.limits.cpu` to avoid the potential of CPU throttling.
#
# Redpanda's resource related CLI flags will then be calculated as follows:
# * `--smp max(1, floor(coalesce(resources.requests.cpu, resources.limits.cpu)))`
# * `--memory coalesce(resources.requests.memory, resources.limits.memory) * 90%`
# * `--reserve-memory 0`
# * `--overprovisioned coalesce(resources.requests.cpu, resources.limits.cpu) < 1000m`
#
# If neither a request nor a limit is provided for cpu or memory, the
# corresponding flag will be omitted. As a result, setting `resources.limits`
# and `resources.requests` to `{}` will result in redpanda being run without
# `--smp` or `--memory`. (This is not recommended).
#
# If the computed CLI flags are undesirable, they may be overridden by
# specifying the desired value through `statefulset.additionalRedpandaCmdFlags`.
#
# The default values are for a development environment.
# Production-level values and other considerations are documented,
# where those values are different from the default.
# For details,
# see the [Pod resources documentation](https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/kubernetes/manage-resources/).

  # limits: null

  # -- CPU resources.
  # For details,

  cpu:
    # -- Redpanda makes use of a thread per core model.
    # For details, see this [blog](https://redpanda.com/blog/tpc-buffers).
    # For this reason, Redpanda should only be given full cores.
    #
    # Note: You can increase cores, but decreasing cores is supported only from
    # 24.3 Redpanda version.
    #
    # This setting is equivalent to `--smp`, `resources.requests.cpu`, and `resources.limits.cpu`.
    # For production, use `4` or greater.
    #
    # To maximize efficiency, use the `static` CPU manager policy by specifying an even integer for
    # CPU resource requests and limits. This policy gives the Pods running Redpanda brokers
    # access to exclusive CPUs on the node. See
    # https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/#static-policy.
    cores: 1
    #

    # This should be true unless the container has CPU affinity.
    # Equivalent to: `--idle-poll-time-us 0 --thread-affinity 0 --poll-aio 0`
    #
    # If the value of full cores in `resources.cpu.cores` is less than `1`, this
    # setting is set to `true`.

  # -- Memory resources
  # For details,

  memory:
    # -- Enables memory locking.
    # For production, set to `true`.
    # enable_memory_locking: false
    #
    # It is recommended to have at least 2Gi of memory per core for the Redpanda binary.
    # This memory is taken from the total memory given to each container.
    # The Helm chart allocates 80% of the container's memory to Redpanda, leaving the rest for
    # other container processes.
    # So at least 2.5Gi per core is recommended in order to ensure Redpanda has a full 2Gi.
    #
    # These values affect `--memory` and `--reserve-memory` flags passed to Redpanda and the memory
    # requests/limits in the StatefulSet.
    # Valid suffixes: k, M, G, T, P, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi
    # To create `Guaranteed` Pod QoS for Redpanda brokers, provide both container max and min values for the container.

    # * Every container in the Pod must have a memory limit and a memory request.
    # * For every container in the Pod, the memory limit must equal the memory request.
    #
    container:
      # Minimum memory count for each Redpanda broker.
      # If omitted, the `min` value is equal to the `max` value (requested resources defaults to limits).
      # This setting is equivalent to `resources.requests.memory`.
      # For production, use 10Gi or greater.
      # min: 2.5Gi
      #
      # -- Maximum memory count for each Redpanda broker.
      # Equivalent to `resources.limits.memory`.
      # For production, use `10Gi` or greater.
      max: 2.5Gi
    #
    # This optional `redpanda` object allows you to specify the memory size for both the Redpanda
    # process and the Seastar subsystem.
    # This section is omitted by default, and memory sizes are calculated automatically
    # based on container memory.
    # Uncommenting this section and setting memory and reserveMemory values will disable
    # automatic calculation.
    #
    # If you are setting these values manually, follow these guidelines carefully. Incorrect settings can lead to performance degradation, instability, or even data loss. The total memory allocated to a container is determined as the sum of the following two areas:
    #
    #- Redpanda (including Seastar): Defined by the `--memory` parameter. Includes the memory used by the Redpanda process and the reserved memory allocated for Seastar. A minimum of 2Gi per core is required, and this value typically accounts for ~80% of the container’s total memory. For production, allocate at least 8Gi.
    #
    # - Operating system (OS): Defined by the `--reserve-memory` parameter. Represents the memory available for the operating system and other processes within the container.
    # redpanda:
      # Memory for the Redpanda process.
      # This must be lower than the container's memory (resources.memory.container.min if provided, otherwise
      # resources.memory.container.max).
      # Equivalent to --memory.
      # For production, use 8Gi or greater.
      # memory: 2Gi
