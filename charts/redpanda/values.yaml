    # Note: You can increase cores, but decreasing cores is not currently supported.
    # See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/350).

    # The Helm chart allocates 80% of the container's memory to Redpanda, leaving the rest for
    # the Seastar subsystem (reserveMemory) and other container processes.
    # So at least 2.5Gi per core is recommended in order to ensure Redpanda has a full 2Gi.
    #

    # requests/limits in the StatefulSet.

    #
    container:
      # Minimum memory count for each Redpanda broker.
      # If omitted, the `min` value is equal to the `max` value (requested resources defaults to limits).

    #
    # This optional `redpanda` object allows you to specify the memory size for both the Redpanda
    # process and the underlying reserved memory used by Seastar.
    # This section is omitted by default, and memory sizes are calculated automatically
    # based on container memory.
    # Uncommenting this section and setting memory and reserveMemory values will disable

    # If you are setting the following values manually, keep in mind the following guidelines.
    # Getting this wrong may lead to performance issues, instability, and loss of data:
    # The amount of memory to allocate to a container is determined by the sum of three values:
    # 1. Redpanda (at least 2Gi per core, ~80% of the container's total memory)
    # 2. Seastar subsystem (200Mi * 0.2% of the container's total memory, 200Mi < x < 1Gi)
    # 3. Other container processes (whatever small amount remains)
    # redpanda:
      # Memory for the Redpanda process.
      # This must be lower than the container's memory (resources.memory.container.min if provided, otherwise
      # resources.memory.container.max).
      # Equivalent to --memory.
      # For production, use 8Gi or greater.
      # memory: 2Gi
      #
      # Memory reserved for the Seastar subsystem.
      # Any value above 1Gi will provide diminishing performance benefits.

    # -- Crash loop limit
    # A limit on the number of consecutive times a broker can crash within one hour before its crash-tracking logic is reset.
    # This limit prevents a broker from getting stuck in an infinite cycle of crashes.
    # User can disable this crash loop limit check by the following action:
    #
    # * One hour elapses since the last crash
    # * The node configuration file, redpanda.yaml, is updated via config.cluster or config.node or config.tunable objects
    # * The startup_log file in the node’s data_directory is manually deleted
