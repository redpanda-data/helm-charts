  # Redpanda makes use of a thread per core model which is described here:
  # https://vectorized.io/blog/tpc-buffers/ For this reason Redpanda should
  # only be given full cores for requests and limits. The recommendation
  # for memory for Redpanda is at least 2GB per core. These values will also
  # affect the --smp and --memory flags which are passed to Redpanda.
