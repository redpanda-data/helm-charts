# This workflow is a hack/workaround.
#
# We require that jobs named "lint" and "summary" pass in order to merge PRs.
# The existing workflows only trigger upon changes to Charts. Sometimes we want
# to make non-Chart changes but security controls make it difficult to
# configure this correctly. Something like
# https://github.com/upsidr/merge-gatekeeper may be a better long term
# solution.
#
# This workflow publishes no-op lint and summary jobs for any PR that doesn't
# match other workflows.
